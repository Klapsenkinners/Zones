  primary: WAX_OFF
  secondary: WAX_ON
  range: 15 # Default: 15
zone-saving:
  # Valid values are SHUTDOWN, MODIFIED, PERIODIC
  # Defaults to MODIFIED
  # SHUTDOWN: Saves the regions.yml file when the plugin is disabled
  # MODIFIED: Saves the regions.yml file when the plugin is disabled or when a region is modified
  # PERIODIC: Saves the regions.yml file periodically
  mode: MODIFIED
  period: 60 # Default: 60, only used when mode is PERIODIC


# Controls whether the plugin should listen for specific events
events:
  # Block physics events can be called thousands of times per tick, so they are disabled by default
  block-physics:
    enabled: false

  explosion:
    # Controls how explosions are handled
    # Valid options are:
    #   - ALL: Checks both ignition and explosion events
    #   - IGNITION: Checks only ignition events
    #   - EXPLOSION: Checks only explosion events
    #   - NONE: Disables explosion checks
    # Defaults to ALL
    # Note that when set to ALL or EXPLOSION, large chain explosions can cause severe lag
    mode: ALL
    # Controls how to handle explosions, if enabled
    # Valid options are:
    #   - ALL: Individually checks every block affected by the explosion
    #   - REGION: Confines explosion result to the region the explosion originated from
    #   - BLOCK: Allows/denies the explosion based on the result of checking the block the explosion originated from
    #   - ANY: Cancels the explosion if any affected block is protected
    # Defaults to ALL
    explosion-mode: ALL
    # Maximum number of explosions to check per tick
    limit: 10
    # What to do when the limit is exceeded
    # Valid options are:
    #   - CANCEL: Cancel all further explosions
    #   - IGNORE: Ignore further explosions
    # Defaults to CANCEL
    limit-exceeded-action: CANCEL

cache:
  # For how long should Cache entries be stored for?
  # Time is in seconds, defaults to 300
  # Has an inaccuracy of ~0.024s/second due to
  # using bitwise shifting to convert to seconds
  # e.g. 300 is actually 307.2 seconds
  ttl: 300
  # How often should the cache be checked for expired entries?
  # Time in minutes, defaults to 10
  check-interval: 10
  # Should there be a limit on the number of cached entries?
  # Set to 0 to disable, defaults to 0
  # Higher values may improve performance, but also increase memory usage
  # For reference, 10.000 cache entries will use ~0.8-1.0MB of memory
  limit: 0
